# The Fundamentals XYZ


Hey, I'm Arav! And, I created “the fundamentals” to help aspiring first-time founders, makers, and just even serial founders to help them kickstart their journey and dream, and to help me achieve my goals to create sustainable businesses.

Today, we interview Josh Manders, a serial founder, and maker from States, who created  NiftyCO, a clear mined startup trying to fix complex issues, who had to go through hard struggles. We talk about his journey, so you can learn from his mistakes and the things he did right.

### Tell Us A Bit About Yourself

### Hello, my name is Josh Manders and I’m an indie maker. A little background on me, I’ve been a developer since 1997 when I learned HTML for the first time when I learned that you don’t have to be a major company to have a website. I quickly engulfed myself in web development and learned CSS and bits of JavaScript. 

### Why did you become a Founder/Developer?

I quickly grew to like programming more than internet marketing, so I focused on improving my craft and building things for others. Now I am transitioning back into building for myself again as an indie maker and entrepreneur creating products such as AppMetrics

What mistakes did you make, when starting your business, and Startup, and what mistakes do as first-time founders do a lot?

First of all, I focused too much on freelancing to make as much money as possible. It gave me freedom but I kept chasing the money, why spend 10 hours a week and make enough money to sustain myself when I can double book 40 hours a week with clients and make tons of money. This burnt me out pretty heavily. Burnout is real and I suggest doing whatever you can to avoid it.

Second of all, Polishing. Too many people, myself included, spend too much time focusing on the little details, which can be important but aren’t to launch. Ship early and ship often. You don’t have to have it 100% perfect before launching.

 ###  What Projects are you Working on right now for your startup, and why are you building something for your Business?

Most services like MailChimp are focusing on people monetizing their subscriber lists, whereas I wanted a service that was geared towards keeping my audience up to date with what I am doing and working on with the occasional message about a product I am selling.
